She is not interested in you. Continuing to emotionally and financially invest in this relationship will make things more awkward for her and more bitter and frustrating for you. She seems to have genuinely appreciated the gifts and likely feels uncomfortable “hurting” you with a direct rejection after such a gesture, but reject you she did. “I don’t want to give you the wrong impression by going on the date.” That was the rejection. Accept that she is not a romantic option and that nothing you can do will change that. She may, one day, change her mind, but you must behave assuming she will not. Start meeting other women.
